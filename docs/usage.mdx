# Usage

After you have successfully installed Cakebase you need to initialize it in your project.

Note: when initializing Cakebase it checks if the JSON file exists, if not it will create one automatically.


this is the easiest way to initialize Cakebase using the following example:
```javascript
const cakebase = require('cakebase')('./data.json');
```

It is also possible to initialize multiple files with Cakebase using the following example:
```javascript
const cakebase = require('cakebase');

const users = cakebase('./users.json');
const sessions = cakebase('./sessions.json')

```
